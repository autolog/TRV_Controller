# Overview

The Autolog TRV Controller is a plugin for version 7+ of the [Indigo Home Automation system][1]. It enables you to control Thermostatic Radiator Valve Z-Wave devices directly from Indigo. It Provides an upgrade path for users of the existing Autolog Stella-Z plugin.

The plugin is currently in private beta testing. Documentation is still in the process of being prepared and once largely complete, the plugin will be uploaded to Github.

Once available, it is **strongly recommended** to read the [Wiki Documentation][2] to familiarise yourself with how this plugin works when comapared to the Autolog Stella-Z Controller plugin.
